class ICA:

    Description:
        Class to perform ICA on steriods
        
    Attributes:
        data: space-time matrix
    
    Methods:
        model_order_selection: do PCA in space to estimate necessary numbers of components
        z_transform: Z-transforms ICA components
        fit_GMM: fits a Gaussian mixture model to the z-transformed components




To do: determine if a component is biological or not 
fit 2 gaussian GLM like model to find the fitting curves for noise and signal
Find ROIs that are more likely to be in the signal curve (P<0.05)
(Plotting it back on a brain?)
